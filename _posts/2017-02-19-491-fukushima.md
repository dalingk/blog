On March 11, 2011 a magnitude 9.1 earthquake off the coast of Japan caused the three operating nuclear reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant to automatically shutdown. Emergency diesel generators immediately kicked in to generate power to run the cooling machinery to remove the decay heat from the reactors. 50 minutes after the generators started a 15 meter tsunami hit the 10 meter sea wall overwhelming it and flooding many of the generators.
