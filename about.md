## Who am I?
I am a student at Western Washington University. I am pursuing the following at WWU:

  * Business minor
  * Honors Program
  * Web Programmer Certification

I have experience with the following programming languages/technologies:

    * Nginx with SSL
    * UWSGI
  * Windows

After I graduate I plan to go into software engineering.

## How did I create this site?

### Blog
The content on this blog was generated with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and uses [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/) as the server. SSL certificates are provided by [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).

### Link Shortener
The [link shortener](https://links.dalingk.com) uses [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/) as a reverse proxy for [UWSGI](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) which is running a [Bottle](http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/index.html) application written in [Python 3.4](https://www.python.org/). The python application uses [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) to store the information for the links. Passwords are hashed using [bcrypt](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bcrypt/2.0.0).

## What are some of my favorite software?

  * [BSPWM](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm): A window manager based on binary trees.
  * [Tmux](https://tmux.github.io/): A terminal multiplexer.
  * [ZNC](http://wiki.znc.in/ZNC): An IRC bouncer.
  * [Rufus](https://rufus.akeo.ie/): A utility for creating bootable flashdrives in Windows.
  * [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/): A systems programming language that fixed issues present in C
